Ocean circulation is an intricate balance between the diabatic processes that change water 
mass properties and the adiabatic processes that move water masses. In observations and 
models the more subtle diabatic processes like mixing and air–ice–sea interactions are 
often masked by adiabatic variability driven by wind and eddies. My overarching research 
vision is to understand how diabatic and adiabatic processes drive the ocean circulation. 

<h2>The Southern Ocean overturning circulation in thermohaline coordinates</h2>

Deep, cold and salty water is drawn to the surface ocean around Antarctica. 
This is controlled by the combined action of winds blowing over the sea surface 
and the stirring by large 100‐km eddies. Studying the ocean around Antarctica is 
notoriously challenging. We therefore have sparse ocean measurements in this region. 
This limits our understanding of some of the processes involved in the circulation of 
deep water, notably, a stage involving the warming and freshening of deep water to form 
intermediate water. Intermediate water plays a key role in drawing excess anthropogenic 
heat and carbon dioxide from the sea surface into the interior ocean. My recent work shows 
that the conversion of deep to intermediate water involves a two‐stage “cold transit” 
that takes place over the course of the austral season. First, during the winter, deep 
water sits below the very cold and fresh surface water. Ice formation around Antarctica 
makes this surface water slightly saltier, decreasing the density difference between the 
deep and surface water. This drives a mixing which cools and freshens the deep water 
while drawing it to the surface. Second, during summer surface warming and melting sea 
ice warm and freshen this deep/surface water mixture forming intermediate water.

<h2>Measuring ocean turbulence</h2>

Measuring ocean turbulence is crucial for understanding how heat and carbon dioxide are 
transferred from the atmosphere to the deep ocean. However, measurements of ocean 
turbulence are sparse. In a recent paper, we use autonomous Seagliders to estimate turbulence in the 
surface kilometer of the North Atlantic Ocean. Using an estimate of the vertical water 
velocity from the flight of the Seaglider through the water, we estimate turbulence by 
assuming the energy of the largest turbulent fluctuations is representative of the energy 
dissipated at molecular scales. This approach has been used previously in an ocean region 
where the vertical gradient of density is small. Our results show that this previous 
approach fails when the vertical density gradient increases, as it does not account for 
other processes that are unrelated to turbulence. We introduce a generalized method that 
isolates only the turbulent processes by accounting for the strength of the vertical 
density gradient. We show that this new estimate agrees with other turbulence 
measurements. Our estimate also agrees well with a simple estimates of turbulence from 
atmospheric processes. This new study therefore presents method that can be applied to 
existing and new Seaglider data to greatly increase our measurements of ocean turbulence.

<h2>Flow topography interactions</h2>

Mesoscale eddies are ubiquitous. They propagate westward and disappear at western 
boundaries. We are investigating the processes involved in their 
dissipation through a multi-scale observational study. We have collected data from 
ship-based microstructure surveys and 18-month moored observations to examine the 
dissipation of mesoscale eddies impinging on steep topography east of the Bahamas in the Atlantic.

The data shown below was collected as part of the MerMEED project. The MerMEED field programme consists of 3 parts: 
1. Microstucture cruises targeting specific eddies. 
2. Glider survey to observe the eddy decay over 6-8 months. 
3. Enhancement of existing RAPID moorings capturing finescale structure and eddy variability over several years. 

Our cruise-based observations show that dissipative processes that act as a sink 
for eddy energy along the slope, and in further work we will quantify an eddy energy budget 
in terms of these dissipative processes.
